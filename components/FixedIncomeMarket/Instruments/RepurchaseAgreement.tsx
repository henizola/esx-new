                  Commercial papers (CPs) are short-term debt obligations issued
                  by large corporations with a maturity period of less than 270
                  days.

                  CPs are usually sold to investors at a discount to face value
                  and primarily issued by corporates to fund working capital or
                  finance short term assets. Investors receive the face value of
                  the CP instrument at maturity.

                  Corporates can efficiently issue which can then be quoted and
